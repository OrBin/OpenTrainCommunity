Our data
========

We take the raw Israel Railways data we receive and do minimal processing - mainly structuring it and marking invalid data as such. Each data point in our database has a pointer to a specific line in one of the raw files we've received from Israel Railways. That way, if and when some question arises about the data, we can always pinpoint the exact source of that data.
