Overview of the OpenTrain project
========
tl; dr - We apply technology to enhance democracy and to empower Israeli citizens. This is our zionism.

This project aims to make Israel Railways punctuality data accessible, simple and understandable for everyone.
Israel Railways is a state-owned company, and we believe that as citizens, it is our right to be able to understand how well this service is functioning.

Unfortunately, not much data is put forth by the Israel Railways company as publicly accessible information.
We have received punctuality data from the Israel Railways company directly and are in the process of transforming, analysing and displaying that data at otrain.org, in a simple and understandable way.

We are a group of volunteers - programmers, designers, data analysts and content writers â€“ that get together every week to achieve that goal.
